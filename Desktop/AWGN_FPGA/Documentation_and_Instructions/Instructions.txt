Open MATLAB. Give the appropriate path so that the project is visible.

In Matlab src folder open try1.m and click run. The following files will be created: norm_dist_values.txt, 
sqrt_values.txt, cosin_values.txt, log_values.txt, seed_hex.txt You will also see the histohram of the 
normal distribution values generated and the result of kstest on the console(it should br 0).

Open Modelsim and create the AWGN project. Make sure to include all the files in RTL src and a=the generated 
MATLAB files in the above step.

Compile and run testbench.
Error AWGN : number of times the difference between actual value of AWGN output from MATLAB and obtained value exceed 
threshold specified in testbench

Error Cosine : number of times the difference between actual value from cosine output MATLAB and obtained value exceed 
threshold specified in testbench

Error Sqrt : number of times the difference between actual value of square root output from MATLAB and obtained value exceed 
threshold specified in testbench

Error Log : number of times the difference between actual value og Log output from MATLAB and obtained value exceed 
threshold specified in testbench 

Open Vivado and click create project. Choose the following device when prompted.
Device : xc7vx690t
Package : ffg1157
Speed grade  : Any will do.
Leave other options as it is.

Add the rewuired constraint (.xdc) in the RTL project folder and the verilog files (.v) exept tb_AWGN. 

Next on Left hand Side click add source > add Simulation source > add the tb_AWGN.v file and all the txt files generated 
by the MATLAB script.

Run Implementation and verify the results.
